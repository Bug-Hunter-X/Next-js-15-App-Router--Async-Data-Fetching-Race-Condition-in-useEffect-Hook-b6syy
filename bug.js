In Next.js 15, a subtle issue can arise when using the `app` directory's `fetch` within a component's `useEffect` hook.  If the data fetching logic is asynchronous, the component might re-render before the data is fully fetched, causing a race condition where the component renders with stale data or before the data has been fully retrieved, resulting in an unexpected error or undefined values. This might not show up immediately and can be particularly hard to debug.
