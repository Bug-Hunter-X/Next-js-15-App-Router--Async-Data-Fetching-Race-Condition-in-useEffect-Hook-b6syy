# Next.js 15 App Router: Async Data Fetching Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a subtle race condition that can occur when using asynchronous data fetching within the `useEffect` hook in Next.js 15's App Router.  The problem arises because the component might render before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to stale data or errors.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the initial render and subsequent updates. The issue is particularly visible in the console logs. 

## Solution

The solution involves using the `use` hook or other data-fetching approaches that are better suited for the App Router to ensure data fetching is handled correctly. The solution file shows a corrected implementation that avoids the race condition.
